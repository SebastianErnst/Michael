                <p>There is a person behind every idea, every note played, every composition and every project. Music and sound always have a personality, and I think it is good to know with whom you share, create and implement your visions. </p>
                <p>Ever since I can remember, music has fascinated me, the different emotions it evokes and the situations you associate with it.</p>
                <p>At the age of 16 I fulfilled my dream of an own guitar and was fascinated by the sound and the creative possibilities it opened up for me. I started imagining little stories and situations to all sorts of different instrumental pieces very early.</p>
                <p>From that moment on I knew that nothing fulfills me more than making music and creating worlds with sound and connect them with situations and emotions.</p>
