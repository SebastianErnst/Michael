                           <li>What is your vision for the song (reference track) ?</li>
                           <li>Did you record in a recording studio or produce everything completely by yourself?</li>
                           <li>Where do you want it to be released (streaming service like Spotify or ITunes, CD, Vinyl)?</li>
                           <li>What kind of file format do I need?</li>

                        <span>I listen to your project and do a "rough mix". Then we have another meeting and discuss everything else, for example which direction to go in and how much freedom I have to add things and/or be creative with effects in order  to get the best results.</span>

                        <span>Once I feel I've reached a place I'm happy with, I'll send it to you so you can give your feedback. If I'm on the right track, I deliver final mix versions.</span>

                        <span>I offer a free test master for every new customer with no strings attached, so you can check if your expectations are met without carrying any risk. Send me one of your songs and you will receive a mastered excerpt of your song back.  In the master I give your productions the final touch and bring your sound to a professional level.</span>
