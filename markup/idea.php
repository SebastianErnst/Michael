                                    <p>Iâ€™m not your average engineer. Due to my background as a <strong>musician</strong> I can draw on years of experience in producing, recording and mixing. What I love most about the job is when I hear my clients <strong>excited</strong> and <strong>happy</strong> about the mix, when they tell me they never thought their song could sound so big or so wide. I'm happy when you're happy. I also like to try <strong>new techniques</strong> and other things to get your projects the best sound possible. Rock, metal, pop, hip-hop, electronic music.</p>

                                    <p>After mixing, mastering is the <strong>final creative step</strong> before your music is released to the public.</p>
                                    <p>An essential aspect of mastering is to get the mix to a <strong>competitive volume</strong>. However, the small corrections that will make a difference in the <strong>final result</strong> are even more important. Every song and every mix has its peculiarities, due to genre and instrumentation, but of course also due to the work of the mixer or the recording studio. In order to make the mix <strong>sound good on all devices</strong> requires individual processing of the material in mastering.</p>
